        <p>Proper nutrition is essential for a woman's overall health, supporting physical well-being, hormonal balance, and reproductive health. Women have unique nutritional needs that change throughout different life stages, including adolescence, pregnancy, lactation, and menopause. A well-balanced diet rich in essential nutrients like proteins, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals helps maintain energy levels, strengthen the immune system, and prevent various health conditions.

            Iron is particularly important for women, as they are more prone to anemia due to menstruation. Foods like leafy greens, lentils, and lean meats help maintain healthy iron levels. Calcium and vitamin D are crucial for bone health, reducing the risk of osteoporosis, especially after menopause. Folic acid is vital for women of childbearing age to support fetal development during pregnancy. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish, nuts, and seeds, promote heart and brain health.
            
            Staying hydrated, reducing processed foods, and consuming a variety of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables contribute to overall well-being. Maintaining a balanced diet, combined with regular physical activity, helps manage weight, improve digestion, and support mental health. Prioritizing good nutrition empowers women to lead healthier, more active lives.</p> </div>
